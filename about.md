### 一段话

From tomorrow on, I will be a happy person;

Grooming, chopping, and traveling all over the world.

From tomorrow on, I will care foodstuff and vegetables,

I have a house,towards the sea, with spring flowers blossoming.

From tomorrow on, I will write to each of my dear ones,

Telling them of my happiness,

What the lightening of blessedness has told me,

I will spread it to each of them.

And give a warm name for every river and every mountain.

Strangers, I will also give you my well-wishing.

May you have a brilliant future!

May you lovers eventually become spouse!

May you enjoy happiness in this earthly world!

I only wish to face the sea, with spring flowers blossoming.
